# Mastermind
This is the 'Mastermind' project for The Odin Project.  This is meant to play a game of Mastermind, using traditional rules, where the player can choose to either be the 'code-breaker', or the 'code-maker'.  The computer, which will be the players competitor, is capable of fullfilling both roles.
